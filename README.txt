PyGolfMini2 is a game made by Federico Angioni and Casper Blaszyk
It is a minigame of minigolf! It features a dynamic powerbar, direction selection, a shot counter and a start menu.

Due to time limitations we could not implement a randomized map generator into the main code, even though the generator code is there.
Try the generator code by runninf mapgen.py and see maps\maze.txt changing.

It has 2 in its name as it is the second version of our game, since the first had to get abandoned due to scope creep.
